# I'm Nate and Sometimes I Actually Write Code

I'm a software engineer that uses Github for all of my non-professional endeavors - short scripting projects, basic web apps, and other sharable tidbits.

A run down of what I've done on Github:
* Built applications for autonomous robots with Capusrover at Brandeis University
* Collaberated with Code For UV to put together web apps for the Upper Valley of Vermont and New Hampshire
* Hacked together some fun side projects of my own

I like to work with:
* 🐍 Python, Flask, ROS
* 🦫️ Go, Gin, Wails
* 💾 PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB and Redis
* 🌐 Javascript, NodeJS, Svelte
* 🤖 C++, Arduino
I also work professionally with ☕ Java + Groovy + Spring, and I enjoy learning new languages and applying them in fun new projects!
